    <h1>The Feline Frontier: Why Stray Animals Threaten Zimbabwe's Food Security</h1>
    <h3>The 24-Rabbit Warning: A Lesson from History</h3>
    <p>In 1859, a man in Australia released 24 rabbits for hunting. He thought it was a minor, harmless act. Within 70 years, those 24 rabbits became 10 billion, destroying millions of acres of farmland and causing an environmental disaster that costs the Australian economy over $200 million annually even today.</p>
    <p>Zimbabwe is currently sleepwalking into a similar trap. What began as un-neutered domestic pets has evolved into a self-sustaining population of "super-predators." Because of our lack of municipal policing on pet registration, mandatory spaying, and leash laws, we have allowed a "Domestic-to-Feral Pipeline" to open.</p>
    <h2>AN OPEN LETTER TO THE CITY OF HARARE</h2>
    <h3>To the City Fathers, Local Councilors, and Residents of our Great City,</h3>
    <p>We are often told that the hallmark of a developing city is its infrastructure—its roads, its water systems, and its lighting. But there is a quieter, biological infrastructure failing right under our noses, and it is threatening the very livelihoods of our residents.</p>
    <p>I am writing to draw your attention to a phenomenon that is largely ignored because it is "too common" to be seen as a crisis: The unchecked proliferation of feral and stray animals, specifically cats, within our urban ecosystems.</p>
