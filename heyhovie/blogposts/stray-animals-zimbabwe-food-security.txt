## **The 24-Rabbit Warning: A Lesson from History**

In 1859, a man in Australia released 24 rabbits for hunting. He thought it was a minor, harmless act. Within 70 years, those 24 rabbits became 10 billion, destroying millions of acres of farmland and causing an environmental disaster that costs the Australian economy over $200 million annually even today.

Zimbabwe is currently sleepwalking into a similar trap. What began as un-neutered domestic pets has evolved into a self-sustaining population of "super-predators." Because of our lack of municipal policing on pet registration, mandatory spaying, and leash laws, we have allowed a "Domestic-to-Feral Pipeline" to open.

## **AN OPEN LETTER TO THE CITY OF HARARE**

**To the City Fathers, Local Councilors, and Residents of our Great City,**

We are often told that the hallmark of a developing city is its infrastructure—its roads, its water systems, and its lighting. But there is a quieter, biological infrastructure failing right under our noses, and it is threatening the very livelihoods of our residents.

I am writing to draw your attention to a phenomenon that is largely ignored because it is "too common" to be seen as a crisis: **The unchecked proliferation of feral and stray animals, specifically cats, within our urban ecosystems.**

### **More Than a Nuisance: A Threat to Food Security**

The general public—and perhaps the City Council—views stray cats as a mere annoyance or, at best, a form of rodent control. This is a dangerous misunderstanding of urban ecology. In Harare, backyard livestock projects (poultry, ducks, and rabbits) are critical pillars of household food security and economic resilience. A single feral cat colony can:

* **Decimate Poultry Projects:** Wipe out an entire batch of day-old chicks in a single night—often the sole weekly income for a family.
* **Introduce Zoonotic Reservoirs:** Cats are primary hosts for parasites like *Toxoplasma gondii*, which contaminate soil and water, posing a direct health risk to humans and livestock.
* **Create Bio-Economic Stress:** Even when they don't kill, their presence induces "predation stress" in livestock, significantly reducing egg-laying rates and weight gain.

### **The Legal Vacuum: Why the Council is Already Failing Its Duties**

It is a common misconception that our City Council lacks the power to act. In reality, the legal mandate already exists within our statutes:

1. **Harare (Dog Licensing and Control) By-laws, 2025:** Section 12 mandates that owners must not allow their animals to roam "at large" beyond the limits of their property.
2. **Animal Health Act [Chapter 19:01]:** Section 9 gives authorities the power to seize or destroy straying animals that pose a threat to animal health or national food security.
3. **Harare (Noise) By-laws:** Section 4(g) prohibits the keeping of any animal which, by repeated noise, disturbs the comfort of the neighborhood.

By failing to enforce these laws, the City is allowing a **Tragedy of the Commons.** Because no one "owns" the strays, no one feels responsible for the damage they cause. We have allowed a "Regulatory Vacuum" where the damage done to the urban farmer’s pocket is treated as a private problem rather than a municipal failure.

### **The Bio-Economic Risk Matrix**

| Threat Type | Impact on Urban Farmers | Public Health Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predation** | Loss of chicks, ducklings, and rabbits. | N/A |
| **Toxoplasmosis** | Contamination of livestock feed & soil. | Risk to pregnant/immune-compromised. |
| **Rabies Vector** | Potential infection of guard dogs. | Fatal viral transmission to humans. |
| **Nuisance Stress** | Decreased egg production in poultry. | Noise pollution & property damage. |

### **A Call for Action: The "One Health" Approach**

We cannot wait for the roads to be perfect before we address food security. We need a modern, technical approach to urban management:

* **Mandatory Registration:** A "Digital Identity" for pets to hold owners accountable.
* **Subsidized TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) Programs:** Partnering with the SPCA and local vets to break the reproduction cycle.
* **Strict Enforcement of Urban Farming Protection:** Recognizing backyard livestock as a legitimate economic asset.

We must stop viewing stray animals as a "bother" to be dealt with later. If we do not act now, we are simply waiting for our "Rabbit Moment"—where the cost of control far exceeds the value of what we are trying to save.

**Yours Sincerely,**
