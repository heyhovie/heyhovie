    <h2>Case study : Rabbitry Success Tracker</h2>
    <p>Role: Instructional Designer & Lead Developer</p>
    <p>Tools: JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3, HTML5</p>
    <p>Target Audience: Small-scale farmers in emerging agricultural markets.</p>

        <h3>1. The Challenge</h3>
        <p>In rural agriculture, specialized knowledge (Cuniculture) is often locked away in dense manuals or expensive textbooks. Local farmers were experiencing a 30% kit mortality rate due to missed biological milestones. The challenge was to provide expert-level guidance that was accessible, localized, and actionable on low-end mobile devices.</p>

        <h3>2. The Solution</h3>
        <p>I developed a Mobile-First Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS). Instead of a passive video or a static PDF, I built a custom JavaScript application that transforms a single data point—the mating date—into a complete, interactive instructional timeline.</p>

        <h3>3. Key Instructional Design Features</h3>
        <p>Just-in-Time Learning (JIT): Information is "chunked" into milestones. Users aren't overwhelmed with Day 45 information on Day 1; they see exactly what is relevant to the current stage of the breeding cycle. Scaffolding for Novices: Using a toggle system, I embedded "Pro-Tips" that explain the why behind the what (e.g., explaining territorial behavior to justify why a doe must be moved to the buck’s cage). Reduced Cognitive Load: I prioritized a high-contrast, "clean-UI" design to ensure readability in outdoor farm environments, reducing the mental effort required to navigate the tool.</p>

        <h3>4. The Intersection of My Skills</h3>
        <p>This project demonstrates my ability to bridge three distinct worlds: Web Development: Writing clean, efficient logic to handle date calculations and responsive UI. Pedagogy: Applying Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory) to ensure the content is practical and goal-oriented. Multimedia Background: Leveraging my film and revision-content experience to write scripts and create visual guides that are technically accurate and easy to follow.</p>
