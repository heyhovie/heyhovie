Project 5 - Rabbitry Success Tracker (JavaScript Web App)

Project Title: The Rabbitry Success Tracker
Role: Instructional Designer & Lead Developer

Tools: JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3, HTML5

Target Audience: Small-scale farmers in emerging agricultural markets.

1. The Challenge (The "Why")

In rural agriculture, specialized knowledge (Cuniculture) is often locked away in dense manuals or expensive textbooks. Local farmers were experiencing a 30% kit mortality rate due to missed biological milestones. The challenge was to provide expert-level guidance that was accessible, localized, and actionable on low-end mobile devices.

2. The Solution (The "How")

I developed a Mobile-First Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS). Instead of a passive video or a static PDF, I built a custom JavaScript application that transforms a single data point—the mating date—into a complete, interactive instructional timeline.

3. Key Instructional Design Features

Just-in-Time Learning (JIT): Information is "chunked" into milestones. Users aren't overwhelmed with Day 45 information on Day 1; they see exactly what is relevant to the current stage of the breeding cycle.

Scaffolding for Novices: Using a toggle system, I embedded "Pro-Tips" that explain the why behind the what (e.g., explaining territorial behavior to justify why a doe must be moved to the buck’s cage).

Reduced Cognitive Load: I prioritized a high-contrast, "clean-UI" design to ensure readability in outdoor farm environments, reducing the mental effort required to navigate the tool.

4. The Intersection of My Skills

This project demonstrates my ability to bridge three distinct worlds:

Web Development: Writing clean, efficient logic to handle date calculations and responsive UI.

Pedagogy: Applying Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory) to ensure the content is practical and goal-oriented.

Multimedia Background: Leveraging my film and revision-content experience to write scripts and create visual guides that are technically accurate and easy to follow.

Pro-Tip for your Portfolio Layout:

Since you have a film degree, consider recording a 60-second "Loom" or "Screen-cast" of you using the app.

Show the app on a mobile view.

Talk through one design choice (e.g., "I chose this red alert color for the Kindling day because it's a high-stakes event").

This proves your communication skills and "walks" the hiring manager through your thinking.
