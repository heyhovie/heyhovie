Project 5 - Rabbitry Success Tracker (JavaScript Web App)

Project Title: The Rabbitry Success Tracker
Role: Instructional Designer & Lead Developer

Tools: JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3, HTML5

Target Audience: Small-scale farmers in emerging agricultural markets.

1. The Challenge (The "Why")

In rural agriculture, specialized knowledge (Cuniculture) is often locked away in dense manuals or expensive textbooks. Local farmers were experiencing a 30% kit mortality rate due to missed biological milestones. The challenge was to provide expert-level guidance that was accessible, localized, and actionable on low-end mobile devices.

PERSONA
Here is a User Persona for your Rabbitry Success Tracker, designed to showcase your empathy and strategic thinking as an ID.

User Persona: "Baba" Moyo
The Small-Scale Emerging Farmer

👤 Profile

Age: 45–55

Location: Peri-urban or rural agricultural zone.

Role: Runs a diversified small-holding (chickens, garden, and recently, rabbits).

Experience: Highly skilled in general farming but new to the specific biological rigors of "Rex" or "New Zealand White" rabbit breeds.

📱 Tech Habits

Primary Device: An entry-level Android smartphone with a cracked screen protector.

Connectivity: Uses mobile data; connection can be "spotty."

App Usage: Uses WhatsApp and Facebook daily. He is comfortable with "scrolling" and "tapping" but gets frustrated by complex menus or tiny text.

🎯 Goals & Motivations

Economic Stability: He wants to sell healthy fryers to local restaurants to pay for his children's school fees.

Efficiency: He is busy. He doesn't want to read a manual; he wants to know what to do today.

Legacy: He wants to build a system his teenage son can help manage.

⚠️ Pain Points (The "Why" for your App)

Memory Overload: He currently tracks breeding dates on a paper calendar in the barn, which gets dirty, wet, or lost.

Kit Mortality: He lost his last litter because he forgot to put the nesting box in on time, and the kits were born on the wire floor.

Information Jargon: Online forums are too technical and use imperial units (lb/°F) while he uses metric (kg/°C).

🛠 How this Persona Influences Your Design (The "ID Justification")
When you present this in your portfolio, add a section called "Design Decisions Based on Persona". This is what wins you the job:

Offline-First/Low Data: "Because Baba Moyo has spotty internet, I built the JavaScript logic to run client-side once the page is loaded, ensuring he can check his dates in the middle of a field without a signal."

High-Contrast UI: "Knowing he uses his phone in direct sunlight, I used a high-contrast 'Dark Mode' or high-visibility color palette and large 20px+ font sizes."

One-Touch Interaction: "To accommodate a user who might be working with his hands, I designed a 'Date Picker' that requires minimal typing."

Micro-Learning: "Instead of a 'Resources' tab, I embedded 'Pro-Tips' directly into the timeline cards so the learning is contextualized to the specific date."

Next Step for You:
To make this persona feel "real" in your portfolio, you could include a photo (stock or AI-generated) of a farmer in your region.

2. The Solution (The "How")

I developed a Mobile-First Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS). Instead of a passive video or a static PDF, I built a custom JavaScript application that transforms a single data point—the mating date—into a complete, interactive instructional timeline.

3. Key Instructional Design Features

Just-in-Time Learning (JIT): Information is "chunked" into milestones. Users aren't overwhelmed with Day 45 information on Day 1; they see exactly what is relevant to the current stage of the breeding cycle.

Scaffolding for Novices: Using a toggle system, I embedded "Pro-Tips" that explain the why behind the what (e.g., explaining territorial behavior to justify why a doe must be moved to the buck’s cage).

Reduced Cognitive Load: I prioritized a high-contrast, "clean-UI" design to ensure readability in outdoor farm environments, reducing the mental effort required to navigate the tool.

4. The Intersection of My Skills

This project demonstrates my ability to bridge three distinct worlds:

Web Development: Writing clean, efficient logic to handle date calculations and responsive UI.

Pedagogy: Applying Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory) to ensure the content is practical and goal-oriented.

Multimedia Background: Leveraging my film and revision-content experience to write scripts and create visual guides that are technically accurate and easy to follow.

Pro-Tip for your Portfolio Layout:

Since you have a film degree, consider recording a 60-second "Loom" or "Screen-cast" of you using the app.

Show the app on a mobile view.

Talk through one design choice (e.g., "I chose this red alert color for the Kindling day because it's a high-stakes event").

This proves your communication skills and "walks" the hiring manager through your thinking.
